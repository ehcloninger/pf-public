# pfdock

PFDock is an app I wrote that exists in Google Play as PurpleDock.  It was my first publicly
released app and a learning exercise.  It intercepts the car dock broadcast and puts up its
own set of activities. I wrote it because at the time the original Motorola RAZR came out, I 
did not like the default car dock experience.  Since then, I made it more generic and keep it
up-to-date.
